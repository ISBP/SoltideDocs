# Staff

### What is a staff member?

Staff members are the people who work behind the scenes — whether it be moderating the game, developing updates, or building new areas!

You can tell whether or not someone is a staff member both from the in-game profile and their Discord profile! For an overview on the ranks, see the section below!

### What staff roles are there?

#### Administrative:

These staff members handle all staff members below them, and generally have full access to the server and can resolve most issues.

**Roles:**&#x20;

* Owner
  * \[<mark style="color:red;">Owner</mark>] prefix in game.
  * Owner role in Discord.
  * These staff members have full control over the server.&#x20;
* Admin
  * \[<mark style="color:orange;">Admin</mark>] prefix in game.
  * Admin and Moderation Staff roles in Discord.
  * These staff members have _near_ full control over the server.

#### Moderation Staff:

These staff members moderate chat (both Discord and in-game, along with game-play). These staff only handle general support, for complex situations you'll need an administrator.

**Roles:**

* Moderator
  * \[<mark style="color:purple;">Mod</mark>] prefix in game.
  * Moderator and Moderation Staff roles in Discord.
  * These staff members keep an eye over the whole server and can issue punishments.
* Trainee
  * \[<mark style="color:yellow;">Trainee</mark>] prefix in game
  * Trainee and Moderation Staff roles in Discord.
  * These staff can issue _some_ punishments, and are the stage that all moderation staff have to go through before becoming a full moderator.&#x20;

#### Server Maintenance & Updates :

These staff members are in charge of coding updates, building, advertising the server, maintaining the server, and fixing bugs.

**Roles:**

* Owners and Admins work is split between this section, moderation, and admin-specific work.
* Developer
  * \[<mark style="color:$info;">Developer</mark>] prefix in game.
  * Developer and Staff roles in Discord.
  * These staff have varying control over the server, and can fix most bugs.
* Builder
  * \[<mark style="color:$success;">Builder</mark>] prefix in game.
  * Builder and Staff roles in Discord.
  * These build new areas for the server and don't have any permissions within the main server.
* Marketing
  * \[<mark style="color:blue;">Marketing</mark>] prefix in game.
  * Marketing and Staff roles in Discord.
  * _This role is NOT the same as Media!_
  * These staff members create official content for official channels to advertise the server.&#x20;

### How do I become a staff member?

#### Applying:

{% hint style="info" %}
Trainee & Builder applications are currently closed. They will re-open in late spring or early summer.
{% endhint %}

To become a staff member join the [Discord](https://soltide.net/discord?direct), and navigate to the staff-applications channel or the marketing-application channel and fill out the corresponding form after reading the requirements.

If you'd like to become a developer please contact us directly by making a ticket within the Discord. Developers must be proficient in Skript and/or java, and have experience working on servers before.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Applications that are jokes or low effort may result in your access to staff applications being revoked!
{% endhint %}

Please note that buying a rank does _not_ effect your chances of becoming a staff member. Applicants that have strong experience and are active within the community have the highest chance of being accepted, so make sure to play the server and make some friends!&#x20;

Applications will generally receive a response within 2 weeks, however during certain periods they may be not reviewed for a longer duration

#### Trainee Process:

If you've applied for trainee there's a few more steps you have to go through to make sure you're a good fit for staff.

If you've been accepted you'll be asked to complete either a verbal or text based interview, up to you, to verify you're a good fit. These interviews take up to 2 hours, so make sure you free time up before scheduling it.&#x20;

After being accepted for trainee, you'll have to record and submit evidence of rule breakers where a higher moderator will review it. Accurate and consistent reports will result in a promotion to moderator, whereas false reports, unreported inactivity, or poor conduct will result in promotions getting delayed or possible demotion depending on the situation.&#x20;
